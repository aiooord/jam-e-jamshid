# Introduction to Jam-e-Jamshid
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Jamejam aims to deliver an advanced reverse engineering suite that combines traditional analysis tools with cutting-edge AI capabilities. Jamejam aims to address the shortcomings of existing solutions, such as IDA and Ghidra, by providing a unified platform that includes a hex editor, selective disassembler (Ai000-Disassembler or Capstone), debugger, decompiler, and AI-driven modules for obfuscation detection and isolated program analysis. Through these features, Jamejam enhances accuracy, speed, and usability, enabling users to analyze complex software and malware more efficiently.

# Scope of Jam-e-Jamshid
Jamejam is designed for reverse engineers, security analysts, and software developers who require robust tools for software analysis, malware detection, and code deobfuscation. The software provides core functionalities for analyzing low-level code, debugging, and decompiling alongside AI-powered features like obfuscation detection and behavior analysis in an isolated environment. Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) further aids users by providing detailed code analysis and summaries.

### Built With

Here we list major frameworks/libraries use to bootstrap jamejam project (It will updated to latest changes). Here are the latest usage:

* ![Qt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Qt-%23217346.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Qt&logoColor=white)
* ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

# Objectives of Jam-e-Jamshid
The key objectives of Jamejam are:
1.	To provide a highly customizable disassembler and debugger, improving upon existing reverse engineering tools.
2.	To integrate AI solutions that can detect and analyze obfuscated code and data automatically.
3.	To introduce an AI-powered sandbox environment where programs are run in isolation, and their behavior is analyzed post-execution.
4.	To leverage LLMs to explain complex code patterns, detect potential vulnerabilities, and summarize key insights for the user.
5.	To enhance usability and performance, ensuring efficient and scalable reverse engineering workflows.
